            <p>The CMT119 module in the Computational and Data Journalism course helped achieve me a wide perspective and deep understanding of the complex yet elegant world of computational thinking and programming. </p>
            <p>Before this module, my grasp of programming was of rudimentary level. The introduction to computational thinking has given me a solid foundation, teaching me to approach problems not just from a human-centric perspective but through the lens of systematic and structured computational logic. This shift in perspective has been invaluable. It has allowed me to tackle challenges with a more analytical and efficient mindset. </p>
            <p>The hands-on experience with web development, specifically HTML and CSS, was quite useful. The structured approach of the module was quite useful for me to explore deeper into the nuances and intricacies of web design. The lectures on CSS Layout, Selectors, and Specificity were particularly insightful. I came away with a granular understanding of how web elements are styled and positioned. </p>
            <p>The introduction to programming in JavaScript added another dimension to my learning. Although the scope of JavaScript in this module was very limited, it opened the doors to the dynamic world of web interactivity. I got a glimpse of how websites can be made more engaging and responsive. </p>
            <p>The module also emphasized the importance of computer fundamentals, grounding my understanding of programming in the foundational principles of computing. This holistic approach ensured that while I was learning the practical aspects of coding, I was also well-versed in the underlying principles that drive computational processes. </p>
            <p>During the module I constantly felt challenged by the materials I was learning but that is exactly why I learned so much. For example, one particular challenge for me was to learn how to make even a simple website responsive across different platforms. I plan to continue practicing and bolster my learning beyond this course. </p>
            <p>Looking ahead, I believe the knowledge and skills I acquired from the CMT119 module will be instrumental as I navigate the rest of the Computational and Data Journalism course. Modern journalism is increasingly data-driven, requiring a blend of analytical skills, programming proficiency, and storytelling prowess. With my foundational understanding of computational thinking, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm better equipped to weave data-driven narratives that resonate with audiences. </p>
            <p>In conclusion, the CMT119 module has been a cornerstone of my academic journey at Cardiff University so far, providing me with the tools, knowledge, and mindset to excel in the dynamic field of Computational and Data Journalism. As I progress through the course, I carry forward the invaluable lessons from this module, ready to tackle the challenges ahead with confidence and competence. </p>
